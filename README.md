# Ppt3dSettingsFinder

In Microsoft PowerPoint, you can apply 3D rotation effects to a shape or an image by specifying “X Rotation”, “Y Rotation”, “Z Rotation” and “Perspective” angles.

But what if you want to project an image onto a given area, e.g. the screen in a photo of a laptop?

Manually finding the correct 3D rotation angles in PowerPoint is virtually impossible. That’s where *Ppt3dSettingsFinder* comes in handy. You specify the four corners of the area and the size of the original image, and the tool tries to find the optimal PowerPoint transformation settings.
